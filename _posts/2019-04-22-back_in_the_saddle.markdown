I want to take some time to reflect on how far I've come in this bootcamp. I haven't been able to focus as much as I would've liked until now due to personal reasons, but now I'm barreling down the path of Object-Oriented Ruby. 

I made it all the way to Object Relationships, yet I ran into a hitch in my understanding while coding the Collaborating Objects Lab. I realize now that I need to thoroughly review the material again in OO Ruby, and I'm making sure to take notes so I can get through the section where I'm currently stuck.

I enjoy studying and the trial and error that goes into getting through each lab. Failure isn't an option, so I guess it's full steam ahead.
