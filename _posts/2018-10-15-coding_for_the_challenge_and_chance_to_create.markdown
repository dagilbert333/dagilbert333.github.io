I've always loved working with computers, so I chose CIS for my major in college. As a part of the curriculum, I was required to take an object-oriented programming course using C++... and absolutely *hated it*. I barely got out of that class with a "C" and decided that programming wasn't my cup of tea. 

Fast-forward to a couple of years ago, and I was thinking about what I could do to expand my skill set, because even though I was excelling in my current field, I felt like I wasn't being challenged enough. I became interested in learning how to build websites, since I'd always found HTML and CSS to be pretty easy to understand. I decided to take a web development course on Codecademy. 

This was the first time I actually delved into online learning for myself, and I breezed through the material, boosting my confidence with every concept learned and challenge passed. Upon finishing that program, and with the wind at my back, I decided to try out other languages through online learning platforms like Udemy, KhanAcadmy, and Treehouse. 

As I went on to learn a bit of SQL, Python, JavaScript, Mongo, Bootstrap, JQuery, etc, I realized that I really enjoyed the challenge of learning to code. Sure, it frustrated me to no end when I couldn't get my code to run, but I learned a lot about myself when I hit these "walls" in my understanding. Namely, that I can never let a puzzle go unresolved, and love identifying problems with my code. On top of that, I feel great when I successfully get a challenging bit of code to run.  

Joining Flatiron School is my biggest investment in learning to code, and I'm thoroughly excited for the opportunity to build on the things I've learned on my own. So far it hasn't been easy, but I don't believe anything worth attaining should be easily obtained. Perhaps I'm a bit masochistic, but I feel like the harder I have to work to understand these concepts, the greater the return will be in the long run.
